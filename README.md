# CPU-Cooler

I built a CPU water cooler in high school from old computer parts to learn how to weld, solder, and basic circuit design. Images and descriptions were taken from a college essay titled Test 1.pdf; in this document uploaded to this respository, the sub-essay under 2 describes this project is greater detail.

The fansâ€™ wires were cut and soldered in parallel at locations marked by the electrical tape. A rubber band held the fans loosely together. Adhesive glue and plastic enclose the circulation system.
